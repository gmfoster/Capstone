#Scapy both sends and receives packets on different Layers of the IP/TCP stack and can be used to
#attack, sniff, forge packets, test, scan, and fingerprint
#Scapy gives all the stimuli sent and responses received

#can be used to send packets defaulted at layer 3 of tcp/ip stack

#with PyX installed you can do graphical and pdf dumps

ls(packet)      #list of fileds values
packet.summary()#summary of packet on one line
packet.show()   #shows developed view of packet
packet.show2()  #show but for the assembled packet
packet.sprintf()#fills a format string with fields values of packets
packet.decode_payload_as() #changes how the payload is decoded
packet.psdump() #draws a postscript diagram 
packet.pdfdump()#draws a pdf
packet.command()#returns a Scapy command that can generate the packet

#The function fuzz() is able to change any default value that is not to be 
#calculated (like checksums) by an object whose value is random and whose type
#is adapted to the field.

#Scapy also has a powerful TCP traceroute function. Unlike other traceroute programs 
# that wait for each node to reply before going to the next, scapy sends all the packets 
# at the same time.
